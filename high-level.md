# High level talk plan

## Goals

The audience will come away with:

- A comprehensive understanding of the inner workings of the Y Combinator
- An intuitive understanding of the Y Combinator at a high level
- Working examples of how to solve recursive problems using the Y Combinator

## Audience

This talk should appeal to people who:

- Have never heard of the Y Combinator before
- Have heard of it but not looked into it
- Have looked into it and found it tough to figure out
- Understand it well and want to feel smart about themselves?

An understanding of functional programming is assumed. Experience with (or expose to) Clojure or other Lisps is helpful, but not required.


## Part 1 - intro and primer

- who am I?
- what is the Y Combinator?
- definition
- source code
- example usage
- what it is used for
- Clojure primer

## part 2 - self application of self application

- back to Y combiantor
- self application^2
- <animation>
- back to Y combinator
- wrapped self-application^2
- <animation>

## Part 3 - final pieces

- delayed evaluation lambda

- what is f?
- use f chain to solve problems
- <animation>?
- outro, reading


# TODO:

- get 3c demo to go red and end?
- make demo for final `count` example
- make slides for delayed eval
- make slides for what the f
- make slides for final example
- make slides for outro
- practice, time it
- start cutting it down to 20 minutes
